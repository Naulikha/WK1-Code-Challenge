# WK1-Code-Challenge
WEEK 1 CODE CHALLENGE 
-This weeks code challenge consists of three challenges:
    Challenge 1 - write code that prompts user to input studdent marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:
     A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
    Challenge 2 -Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
    For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
    Challenge 3 -Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

-As per demand I've solved these challenges using JAVA SCRIPT 
-I have placed a bunch of comments on the solution (sentences that begin with \\ are comments)
